# Clock
The Simple Clock I‚Äôve developed is a web application that provides a clean and easy-to-read time display. It‚Äôs perfect for any device, whether it‚Äôs a computer or mobile browser. The clock updates every second to ensure accurate timekeeping.

The design is minimalist with a monospace font and a gradient background that transitions from dark blue to purple. The time is displayed in a large font size that adjusts according to the viewport width, making it easily visible on all screen sizes.

This project combines web technologies (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) to create a functional and user-friendly digital clock. ‚è∞üåê
